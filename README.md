# tissue - A file-based issue tracker - WIP
## !!!NOTE!!! Work In Progress
This project exists to hold the tissue name until the first version is released.
## Why another issue tracker?
There are hundreds of high-quality, mature issue trackers out there. But most of them are server-based and proprietary, which means that you are locked-in to using their system forever once you've built a critical mass of tickets.
Tissue is designed to work around this by storing all of a project's issues as simple text files within the project repository itself. The host source control system handles versioning and logs while providing transparent access to all issue data to all interested parties.
